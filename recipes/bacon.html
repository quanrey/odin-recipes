    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> This top-rated appetizer perfectly balances smoky, salty, and sweet flavors. "It covers ALL the bases!," raves INDYJOANIE. "I used 1/2 piece thick sliced bacon and was perfect. I also baked at 400 for approximately 20 minutes, turning 1/2 way through. These wraps are good when hot, but I think even better after cooled a bit." </p>
