   <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> Coquito is a creamy, tropical, Puerto Rican holiday drink with tons of coconut flavor. 
        It's made with both evaporated and condensed milk, cream of coconut, spices, rum, and — in this version — egg yolks. <br>
        It is always requested at my holiday gatherings. Sometimes I hide it in the fridge to keep for myself! <br>
        Serve in glass cups and sprinkle with more cinnamon if desired. Feliz Navidad! <br>
